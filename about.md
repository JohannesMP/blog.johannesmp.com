I am a [BSCS degree](https://www.digipen.edu/academics/degree-programs/bs-in-computer-science/) student at DigiPen. I started my program in 2014.

In the past I've worked as support for [Humble Bundle, Inc.](http://www.humblebundle.com) and as a full-stack developer at [Frozenbyte Games](http://www.frozenbyte.com/).
