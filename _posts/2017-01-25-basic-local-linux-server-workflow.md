In this post I will go over a basic workflow for managing a local Linux server install via [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox) on Windows, with a focus on having a local dev environment that mirrors a dedicated Linux server. This guide will walk you through installing Linux, setting up SSH port forwarding, and include a few useful configuration and workflow tips.

This guide will be using Ubuntu 16.0.1 and [MobaXterm](http://mobaxterm.mobatek.net/) as the SSH client. You are welcome to use another SSH client such as [bash for windows in Windows 10](http://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) if you so choose.

This post assumes you have used VirtualBox for [running desktop versions of Linux](http://www.beopensource.com/2016/05/how-to-install-Ubuntu-1604-LTS-in-Virtual-Box-VmWare.html), and have a [basic grasp of Linux commands](http://linuxcommand.org/learning_the_shell.php).
